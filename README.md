My name is Alesia and I am 23 yers old. As a person in my twenties, I meet all the challenges that many other young people experience too and my diploma project is about one of the most important parts of our life - our identity. My theoretical part looks at identity throughperspective of nationality and how it affects who we are. My practical part is a story that looks at the process of developing identity through my own story.
